            Hello, I'm Amy, and my professional journey has been an exploration from marine biology to software engineering. Graduating from UCLA with a degree in Marine Biology, I initially aspired to contribute to marine conservation. However, upon gaining practical insights into the field, I realized it wasn't the right fit for me.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            During my time in marine biology, I actively participated in diverse projects, with a keen focus on marine algae. Notable experiences include collaborating on an experiment comparing beach wrack ecosystem compositions created by native and non-native macroalgae species. Additionally, I led research projects in Mo'orea, French Polynesia, examining coral reef compositions and the relationship between different species of brown macroalgae.

            <br/>
            Post-college, I transitioned to education, teaching a TA-led marine biology lab. This role involved guiding students through ecological research, allowing them to conduct experiments independently.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            A pivotal moment came when I declined a job offer in aquatic conservation, realizing that it wasn't my true calling. I briefly explored UI/UX design before discovering my passion for software development. Through platforms like Codecademy, I began my journey into full-stack engineering, cultivating the skills necessary for this dynamic field.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            My diverse background, bridging marine biology and education, uniquely informs my approach to software engineering. I bring a blend of problem-solving skills, creativity, and an understanding of interconnected systems, reflecting the intricacies found both in nature and code. I look forward to contributing to the ever-evolving landscape of software development.
