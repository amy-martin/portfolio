        <p>
            My name is Amy Martin, and I am a full-stack developer located in Los Angeles, CA.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            I originally pursued a degree in Marine Biology, fueled by a passion for the natural world. 
            However, I found a new passion in software engineering and made the decision to switch paths. 
            Now, armed with a background in marine biology and a drive to thrive in the tech industry,
            I'm eager to combine my analytical mindset and problem-solving skills to create impactful solutions 
            in the world of software engineering.
